    <h1 style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">One of my Interests- Skiing</h1>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">I enjoy skiing; it is not only one of my favourite sports but also one of my favourite hobbies. I was a competitive skier for a few years when I was younger, and I raced at several different ski hills in Ontario and Quebec.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Here are some pictures of the ski hills where I raced when I was younger:</p>

    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;"> Now that I am a competitive swimmer, and owing to the amount of time that my swimming takes up, I am no longer a competitive skier, but I still enjoy the sport recreationally. I travel with my family on ski vacations on weekends and holiday breaks throughout the winter. Some of my favourite ski resorts are Mont Tremblant in Quebec and Jay Peak in Vermont. My family and I went to Vermont for a week during the recent Christmas Break. I had a lot of fun skiing there, and I recommend Jay Peak as a ski destination if you are searching for one.</p>
