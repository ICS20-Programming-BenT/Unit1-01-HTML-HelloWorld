    <h1 style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Hello, World!</h1>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">My name is Ben Thomson, and I am a Grade 10 programming student at Immaculata High School. I am learning to code and this is my first time using HTML. On this short webpage, I will write about my favourite pass-time, as well as my least favourite subject in school. Thank you for reading! </p>
    <h2 style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">My favourite pass-time:</h2>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">I really enjoy swimming, it is one of my favourite activities in the whole world. In fact, I love it so much that I am a competitive swimmer. I practice 11 times a week, nine times in the pool and two times in the gym.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Here is an image of one of the pools I swim at:</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">My least favourite subject:</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">My least favourite subject in school is Phys-Ed, because I do not like most of the sports that are played in that class. Because of my swimmung schedule, I rarely have enough energy to actively participate to the best of my abilites in Phys-Ed. In addition, I am not naturally gifted with most sports.</p>
