      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>My name is Ben Thomson, and I am a Grade 10 programming student at Immaculata High School. I am learning to code and this is my first time using HTML. On this short webpage, I will write about my favourite pass-time, as well as my least favourite subject in school. Thank you for reading! </p>
      <h2>My favourite pass-time:</h2>
      <p>I really enjoy swimming, it is one of my favourite activities in the whole world. In fact, I love it so much that I am a competitive swimmer. I practice 11 times a week, nine times in the pool and two times in the gym.</p>
